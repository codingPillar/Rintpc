## Robot INTer Process Communication

### This project should be used to facilitate seperation of different subsystems in a robot (or any project really) but without having to rely on a very complicated ecosystem like ROS.

### Available features would be to start seperate nodes independantly and to enable easy communication through requests and messages

## Project Layout

### We have two subprojects (master and node)

## Master
### Backend that has to be running in order for the nodes to be able to communicate with each others

## Node
### Library used for each individual node to be able to communicate with the rest of the system

## Building and User Guide
### Each subprojects contains readmes that explain how to build and use each section seperatly and an example folder

## Contribution
### Contributions can be made directly as pull requests

## License
### Open Source (ENJOY !!)
